> Welcome to Parade!

Everybody on The Parade Team is *so* excited to get Parade on the phones of students! We're calling this initial launch our "Beta Phase", where
we encourage student leaders to add their organizations, and for all students to get a feel for how to navigate the app before the fall!

I'm writing this guide to (hopefully) clarify any questions you may have about navigating Parade. Feel free to skip around to a particular section - let's get started!

<h2>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h2> (todo: make it link)
- Logging in and Signing up
- Adding an Organization (Org)

- DIAGRAM OF MENU
- FOLLOWING
- USER PROFILE (Edit user)
- NOTIFICATIONS
- EXPLORE

<h2>Logging in and Signing up</h2>

For our pilot, all students will need to login with their **husky gmail account**. On the gmail page, type in your entire husky email `(<lastname.f>@husky.neu.edu)`.
You'll then be redirected to the familiar Northeastern single sign on page. We never store (or even see) your password.

If this is your first time logging in, you'll be directed to registration.  You'll be ask to pick at least three *tags*. Tags are pieces of data that
we use to curate your Parade experience.  Tags could be a college like `CCIS`, a theme like `community`, or like my personal favorite `free food`. You may pick as many tags as you'd like. You can view or edit your tags later by visiting your **User Profile** (more on that later).

<h2>Adding an Organization (Org)</h2>

Next stop on the registration flow asks if you'd like to add your organization to Parade. Parade relies on student leaders adding and
maintaining their organization's homepage.

Note that you can create an org at **any time** from the main side menu, not just when initially signing up for the app!

>Important Note: Designate **one** person from your org's e-board to create the Parade page. An org should only be created once.
 Later (in-app), the creator can easily accept additional people to the org as admins.


When you create an org, you are **automatically made an admin** of the organization.  Being the admin of an org lets you:
- Post events on behalf of the org
- Accept other people's requests to become admins
- Delete events

Admins of orgs appear publicly with a trophy next to their name.

<h2>Requesting admin on an Org</h2>

Requesting to be an admin of an org requires an existing admin to approve a request that you make. At the bottom of every org is a button "Request Admin". Tapping that
button will place your request in the existing admin's "Notification" page.

![requestNotif]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/resources-welcome/requestNotif.png)

The approver will need to manually visit this page on **their** account. The Notification page can be accessed from the side menu of the left

(Note: As of version 1.2, admin will *not* receive a typical push notification. Alert existing admins yourself after sending this request).

<h2>Following vs Admin</h2>

**Following:** Anybody can follow an organization by visiting an org's profile page and pressing the "Follow" Button. This will add the org to the user's
"Orgs" page and place all upcoming events into a dedicated section of the "Explore" page. Following is a good way to keep up with clubs you frequently take part in.

All events on Parade are public. Following is just a convenience, but not necessary to view an org's events.

**Admin:** Orgs generally only have a handful of admins. These students are responsible for keeping the org's events up to date. Admins can (and should) also follow their
org.

<h2>Deleting Events</h2>
Deleting events is normally unnecessary - outdated events are automatically removed from the org's list of events.
If an typo was made, or an event happens to get canceled, admins can delete an event by tapping on the event and pressing the trashcan in the top, right corner
of the expanded event's details page.

<h2>Sharing events</h2>

Events and orgs can be shared in multiple places. On iOS, a page will pop up presenting different sharing options. Anybody **logged into the app**
can tap this link on their phone and be brought directly to the event or org.

For example, [tapping this](https://parade.events/o/5b7b5479b04daa3649807287) on your phone will open the Parade org.

Users must login before using this link.

<h2>Personal User Profile</h2>
Tapping on your profile photo or name in the side menu will bring you to your personal profile. Your profile keeps track of events you've shown interest in, as
well as provides a list of all the orgs you're following.  From this page you can also view or edit your tags.
