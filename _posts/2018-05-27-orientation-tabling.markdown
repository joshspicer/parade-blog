_It's your first night on campus, everything about college still feeling so new. You're led onto the Library Quad and walk past the endless line of (literally) hundreds of different clubs at the Activities Fair. The quad is crowded with eager students just like yourself, and even more eager students manning the tables that line the sidewalk. As the clubs start to pack up, you realize that you only got to meet a select handful of the 400+ organizations present. Maybe you found the right club for you, or maybe you'll need to wait until next year's fair..._

Ever since we started parade a few months ago, i've regularly thought back to my experience at the activities fair as motivation. The student-run orgs on Northeastern's campus are maintained by incredibly hardworking people. We at parade are determined to create a platform that allows their hard-work to be recognized and enjoyed by as many students as possible.

This fall, we will be launching parade's "Explore" page, which aims to serve as a "24/7 Activities Fair". Parade will allow students to intelligently discover events and opportunities throughout the semester. We aim to eliminate the stress of marketing from students orgs, and hope to provide endless interesting opportunities for our fellow students.

_That said_, parade will be at this year's activities fairs introducing ourselves to students and clubs alike.

The Activities Fair will take place on the following dates from **6:30 â€“ 7:45 p.m.** on the Library Quad (near Snell).

  * Monday, June 11
  * Monday, June 18
  * Monday, July 2
  * Monday, July 16
  * Monday, July 23
  * Monday, July 30


 We're very excited to get feedback on the work we've done so far, and are looking forward to learn what more we can add to the parade experience. **_We may also have some parade swag to hand out..._**
