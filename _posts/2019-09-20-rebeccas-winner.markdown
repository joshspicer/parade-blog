We had a very exciting past few weeks running our first ever raffle, to give away free Rebecca’s for a month to one lucky Parade user. As huge fans of Rebecca’s, we enjoyed connecting students with our platform and rewarding them with the opportunity to win big!

Parade received tons of engagement from students in these first few weeks of Fall 2019, including 437 new accounts, 48 new Org Pages, and 93 new events. As the platform for event discovery at Northeastern, we are so excited to see students using the app to foster community-building on our campus. 

We announced the winner on our Instagram story following the end of the raffle period (September 13th at 11:59pm) - a big congratulations to Lauren Howe and the Northeastern Chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers (NUASCE) for winning our Rebecca’s Raffle! 

Lauren and the E-board members of NUASCE intend on hosting a club outing to Rebecca’s with the prize money. Congrats again to her and a big thank you to everyone who entered our contest.

Didn’t win? Don’t fret! We have more raffles and giveaways in the works for Parade users, lookout for our announcements soon on social media and this blog!
