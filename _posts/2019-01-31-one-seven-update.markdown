With Parade’s newest update (1.7), we introduced several features to better inform admins about who’s interacting with their orgs and events.

For any club you’re the admin of, you can now see a list of all your org’s followers. For each event, [admins](https://parade.events/blog/welcome-guide/#requestingAdmin) now have the ability to see who is “Going” and “Interested”.

Thanks for using Parade - we have lots of exciting new features planned to make managing events even easier! Please [send us feedback](mailto:feedback@parade.events) if you have suggestions for how we can make Parade work better for you.
